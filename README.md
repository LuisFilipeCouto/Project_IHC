### About the project
This project involves the development of a functional web application that simulates an online marketplace for buying and selling cars, following a human-centered approach <br>

The project development consisted of three distinct phases:
  1. [**Low Fidelity Prototype**](prototype)
  2. [**Functional Prototype**](app)
  3. [**User Evaluation**](user_evaluation)
     
The final result is a functional web application designed to ensure a smooth and user-friendly interaction experience for all system users <br>
